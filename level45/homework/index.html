            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː, -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, <br>
            or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, <br>
            appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. <br>
            Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears <br>
            include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, <br>
            plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.</p>

                The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the grey wolf or gray wolf, is a canine native to Eurasia and North America. <br>
                More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though grey wolves, as popularly understood, <br>
                include only naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest wild extant member of the family Canidae, <br>
                and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, <br>
                as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, <br>
                such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. <br>

                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. <br>
                It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. <br>
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. <br>
                A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. <br>
                The lion is an apex and keystone predator. <br>
